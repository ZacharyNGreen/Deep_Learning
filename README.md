After running both the fng and closing price model, I believe that the closing price model performs better than the fng model. 

The fng model produced a loss rate of ~10.9% after 10 epochs, whereas the closing price model produced a loss rate of produced a loss rate of ~6.9% after 10 epochs. Given the lower loss rate I believe that the Closing price model is a better performing model.

Model performance could perhaps change with different numbers of attributes selected or different number of hidden layers chosen.
